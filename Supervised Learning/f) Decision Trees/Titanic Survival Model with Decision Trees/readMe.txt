In this example, we have taken a titanic survival dataset, in which we will try to train our decision tree on the basis of multiple attributes i.e. age, fare, cabin etc. After that for improving accuracy, we will tune some hyperparameters i.e. depth, min sample leaf and min sample splits of of decision tree. 

By hyperparameter tuning, we improved test set accuracy from 81% to 85%.

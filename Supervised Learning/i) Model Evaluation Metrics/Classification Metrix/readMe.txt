In this example, we will use different techniques to evaluate our models. The Spam Classification dataset used here is for Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, F Beta Score and comparison between different models are done using test.py file. 

Firstly, data was converted from test to numbers using CountVectorizor and than different models such as Bagging Classifier, Random Forest, Adaptive boosting, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine was used for classification and prediction of spam emails.

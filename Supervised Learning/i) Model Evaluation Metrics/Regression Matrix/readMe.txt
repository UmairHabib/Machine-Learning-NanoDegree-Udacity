Regression matrix is used as evaluator of model i.e. R2 score

In this example, I have used Boston data from sklearn and calculated different regression models. The models included RandomForestRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor, LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor. 

After training models, we used testing data for prediction and calculated R2 score, Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error. Random Forest was the best amongst all.

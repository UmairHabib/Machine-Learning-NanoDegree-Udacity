Learning Curve helps us choosing the best model.

In this example, I have used three different classifiers to compare their learning curve and check which classifier suits best on our data. The output of learning curve function used was scores instead of errors, so flip all the curves obtained from matplot.

I have used three different classifier named as Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting i.e. Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine. Out of all classifier, Gradient boosting worked well.

In this example, we have used patients of Diabetes to extract features and best suited model for them. We have taken three models named as Random Forest, AdaBoost and Support Vector Machine. 

Out of all of them, AdaBoost worked well. After that we used RandomizedSearchCv for collecting importance of different features among dataset.

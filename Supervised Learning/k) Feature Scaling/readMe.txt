In this example, we have done feature scaling using standard scaler from sklearn preprocessing package. In this we can see that, 1st and 4th column has been set to zero which is chaned output than previous simple regularization example. We have used Lesso for our model and generalized our model through L1 regularization.

Our dataset has 7 columns out of which 6 are considered as different features and 7th is output column.

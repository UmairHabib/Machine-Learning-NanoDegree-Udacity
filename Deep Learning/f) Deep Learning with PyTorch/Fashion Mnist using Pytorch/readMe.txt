In this example, I have taken Fashion MNIST dataset which will be used for classifying through Neural Network using Pytorch. Here, I have used input layer of 784 neurons and output layer of 10 neurons. Moreover, this neural network has 3 hidden layers each with Relu as activation function. Output layer has activation function Log SoftMax and our error function for neural network is NLLLoss function.

I have used Adam Optimizer instead of gradient which uses momentum along with momentum.
